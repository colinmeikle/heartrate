# heartrate
sming heartrate library for pulse sensor, this is a port of the ardiuno code found here https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor-Amped
I've not formatted the output the same as the original, this is required to use the processing visulizer application, this is easy to do if required.
